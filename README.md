- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, requests a web-based game that will serve multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, only available on Android devices currently. The game will be loosely like the popular 1980s game show, Win, Lose or Draw. 

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I thoroughly provided recommendations for the clients. I included prominent characteristics that the client would need when developing their application. 

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

During the process of working on the design document, I found it helpful to know the client's requirements and any additional design constraints when developing the code. This provides what is being asked of and what is also needed to produce the desired application the client is looking for. 

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I'd revise my evaluation chart, which included different development tools and their characteristics for both server and client. I believe I could have included better details and be more informative when it came to describing the pros and cons of each operating system with additional details that the client may want to know as options such as exact costs, licensings, etc. 

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To include the user's needs into the software design, a designer needs a better understanding on how the user intends to use the product, and the requirements that follow to do these user-based tasks. It is essential to consider the user's needs when designing as the user perspective will be more important than from a designer or developer perspective.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The process of creating an outline helped when designing software. The design is also influenced by the client and how the user's intend to use the software. A strategy that I would include in future designs to similar software application would be to creating a design with minimal and intended functions so that it will be easy to use and understand.
